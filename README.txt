This is a site where you can search for cards and also build decks to build the perfect deck. I've used similar sites to this but found their sites confusing
so I tried to create a simple site that is fun to look at that accopblish the goal of searching cards and building decks.
In this project you can search for cards and see the prices. So if you wanted to check for the price of a card because you wanted to buy it you can.
Or if you just want to see what the most expensive card is you can. The deck builder allows you to build your decks and save them. So if you are thinking
of creating a new deck and want to see how much it cost this is the place.
Some problems I faced were getting the deck load to work , also the leader filter wasnt working because
I was using a post but when sending all the cards throught the post it was too large 
so I changed it to get the cards in the /getLeaders and filter it there and send it back.
and also making sure that the zip worked. 
I used youtube videos for pagination and react hook help and also W2Schools for help.
